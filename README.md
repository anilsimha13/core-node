## Episode 01 | Introduction to Node.js

### Key Concepts

- **What is Node.js?**
  - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - Allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.
  - It was an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
- **Engine**
  - Node.js uses the V8 engine, which is the same engine that powers Google Chrome.
  - V8 compiles JavaScript directly to machine code, making it very fast.
  - Firefox uses the SpiderMonkey engine, and Safari uses the JavaScriptCore engine.
